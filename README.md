# Homophily on Human Interaction via. Stochastic Block Model network 


__Description__:


• __Homophily describes the group cluster of people tending to meet each other with similar property e.g. same age by homophily clustering probability in Stochastic Block Model (SBM) Network.__ 

• __This project is to quantify the clustering probability of homophily in human connection, and also probability of heterophily (clustering of different group of people) in their human interaction based on the experimental database from International Conference on Computational Social Science 2017 (ICCSS17).__

• __Our results represent that the likelihood of gathering of homophily people could contribute to human connection with common likeliness by social status.__
